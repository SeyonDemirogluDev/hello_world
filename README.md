# Greetings, dear world!

    I must greet the divine world first,
    I shall be thy servant for eternity.
    I must bring thy water to quench thy thirst,
    I shall secure thy legacy.

    This poem was created out of the creator's head,
    so give this repository a star.
    I must say that if thy do such thing,
    the creator will come far.

    I should call myself a professional,
    for what I have done.
    Indeed it is a good time to call it quits,
    and have a sip of rum.

    I sense a joke in the previous one,
    therefore I will commit to the code.
    But I must say that I can be silly,
    for that I did not lay a node.
